Mapzen's elevation service provides digital elevation model (DEM) data as the result of a query. The elevation service data has many applications when combined with other routing and navigation data, including computing the steepness of edges or generating an elevation profile along a route.

For example, you can get elevation data for a point, a trail, or a trip. You might use the results to consider hills for your bicycle trip, or when estimating battery usage for trips in electric vehicles.
